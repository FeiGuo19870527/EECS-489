Assignment 2

All algorithms are explained in comments at the beginning of the Matlab code.
Attached Mathematica notebooks were used to help work solutions, but are not 
necessary to understand the Matlab code, and may not reflect final algorithms.

Solutions
All lengths in meters. All angles in radians.
